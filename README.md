# sas-portal
This is a wordpress plugin that adds the parents portal to a school website. 

It pulls data from a school management system I have developed and enables parents to log in using their registered phone numbers and passwords sent via SMS and subsequently access information pertaining to their children.

During COVID-19 lockdown it was used to deliver home packages to students and lesson videos (e-learning)
